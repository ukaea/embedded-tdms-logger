		<h1>File/Custom Device Level Configuration</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		The Main page allows you to configure file level properties of the TDMS logs as well as the behaviour of the custom device during execution.br>
		
		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		Available for the user to configure is:</br>
		- The name of the custom device (not the same as the file name of the TDMS logs).</br>
		- The filename as derived for the TDMS files, this can be a expression which incorporates the time and date into the file name construction during logging.</br>
		- The directory for which to log files into.</br>
		- The meta data associated on the file level in the TDMS file as a key value pairing (property name, property value).</br>
		- Conditions for which to segment the TDMS file into seperate files during logging, namely by size in MB or by time in seconds. A common use case is to segment the file to every hour.</br>
