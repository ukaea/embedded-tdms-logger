		<h1>Waveform Channel Level</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		The Waveform Channel Level page allows you to configure a waveform channel logged in the TDMS file. These are channels you want recorded that exist as waveforms in the target controller and record at varying rates to the controller.</br>
		
		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		Available for the user to configure is:</br>
		- The waveform being recorded</br>
		- The meta data associated on the channel level in the TDMS file as a key value pairing (property name, property value).</br>
		- The Decimation of the specific channel, i.e. downsampling from the waveform rate.</br>
		- The name of the channel as it is recorded in the TDMS (always matches as it appears in the Custom Device but does not necessarily match to the actual waveform source). </br>
		
		<p>
		You set the source of waveform data within the channel page itself rather than mappings, unlike the typical channels in this custom device.
